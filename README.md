**# AI-Powered Q&A with File Upload**

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that allows users to **upload PDF files, ask questions based on the content, and receive both text and audio answers** using a **FastAPI backend**.

---

## **🚀 Features**

✅ **Upload PDF Files** – Users can upload multiple PDFs for processing.

✅ **File Processing via FastAPI** – The backend extracts information from PDFs.

✅ **AI-Powered Q&A** – Users can ask questions based on the uploaded PDFs, and the system returns answers.

✅ **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Support** – Converts the answer into audio format for playback.

---

## **🔧 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

---

## **📥 Installation**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suryask007/RAG-with-TTS.git
cd RAG-with-TTS
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **▶️ Running the Application**

Run the `root.py` script, which starts both **FastAPI and Streamlit**:

```bash
python root.py
```

---

## **🛠️ Usage**

1️⃣ **Upload PDFs** – Click on the upload button and select PDF files.

2️⃣ **Process Files** – The app sends the files to FastAPI for processing.

3️⃣ **Ask a Question** – Enter a question related to the uploaded files.

4️⃣ **Get Text Answer** – The model will return an answer based on the PDFs.

5️⃣ **Generate Audio Answer** – Click on "Get Audio Answer" to listen to the response.

---

## **🔗 API Endpoints**

- **`POST /file_upload`** → Uploads and processes PDFs.
- **`POST /model`** → Takes a question and returns an answer.
- **`GET /audio`** → Converts the text answer to an audio response.

---

## **⚠️ Troubleshooting**

⚡ **App restarts on button clicks** – This is due to Streamlit's rerun behavior. The app uses `st.session_state` to prevent reprocessing on every button click.

⚡ **FastAPI Not Running** – Ensure FastAPI is running before launching Streamlit.

⚡ **Audio Not Playing** – If `pydub` fails, download the file manually from the UI.
